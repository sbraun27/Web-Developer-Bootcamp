    <p>The <b>tiger</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger">(Panthera tigris)</a> is the largest extant cat
        species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is
        most
        recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator,
        primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
        predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of
        its
        offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their
        mother's home range to establish their own.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris. This was a
        borrowing
        of Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river
        Tigris.[4] The origin may have been the Persian word tigra meaning 'pointed or sharp', and the Avestan word
        tigrhi
        'arrow', perhaps referring to the speed of the tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have any
        meanings
        associated with tigers.[5]</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy and genetics</h2>
    <h3>Scientific Name</h3>
    <p>1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis
        tigris.[2] In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus
        Panthera
        using the scientific name Panthera tigris.[8][9]</p>
